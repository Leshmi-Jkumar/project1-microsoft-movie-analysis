Conclusion


Microsoft is highly recommended  to follow the following suggestion according to my analysis:
If there is a high budget available, the best movies to produce are in the genres of action, adventure, drama and comedy respectively as this gives the maximum revenue and subsequently profit.
If there is a budget constraint, the best movies to produce movies with high ROI: are horror, mystery, sci-fi, fantasy, and animation.
Best studios to collaborate with are BV, Uni, Fox and WB as they produce high-gross movies.
Best time to release movies is during Christmas and the School holiday seasons.
